Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) use various algorithms to learn from data and make predictions or decisions.

In **ML**, common algorithms include:

* **Linear Regression**: Used for predicting continuous values. It models the relationship between input and output with a straight line.
* **Logistic Regression**: A classification algorithm that predicts the probability of binary outcomes (e.g., spam or not).
* **Decision Trees** and **Random Forests**: Tree-based methods used for both classification and regression. Random Forests combine multiple trees for better accuracy.
* **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Classifies data based on the majority class among its nearest neighbors.
* **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Finds the best hyperplane that separates classes in a high-dimensional space.
* **K-Means Clustering**: An unsupervised algorithm that groups data into k clusters based on similarity.

In **DL**, algorithms are based on neural networks:

* **Feedforward Neural Networks**: The simplest form, where data moves in one direction.
* **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Excellent for image and video processing.
* **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Designed for sequential data like time series or text.
* **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**: A type of RNN that handles long-term dependencies.
* **Transformers**: Advanced models used in NLP tasks like language translation and chatbots.

Each algorithm serves different tasks and is chosen based on the problem and data.
